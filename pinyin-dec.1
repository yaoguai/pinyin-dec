.TH PINYIN\-DEC 1 2015 pinyin-dec "Pinyin Decorate"
.SH NAME
pinyin\-dec \- decorate Pinyin text with its proper diacritics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pinyin\-dec
[options] [string ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts numbered Hanyu Pinyin text into its proper form with
diacritics. Input strings are read from command-line arguments, or if none are
provided, the input text is read from standard input (stdin). Text that does
not look like a Pinyin word is generally ignored, and is preserved in its
original form in the output.
.PP
The program knows about six Pinyin tone numbers: 1 (high), 2 (rising), 3 (low),
4 (falling), and 0 or 5 (neutral). It also converts v or u: in Pinyin words
into the proper form of Ã¼. Capitalization also makes no difference, and
pinyin\-dec is able to handle Pinyin text regardless of its capitalization.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR

.SH EXIT STATUS

traces for debugging, enable the \*(lqverbose\*(rq option.
